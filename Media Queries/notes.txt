Media Queries
*************

media is actually key word to breakpoint  
to enter new layer

Adding breakpoint to define responsive layouts

eg:when you are using smaller screen like mobile 
that time your media query works good

index.html
<div>
</div>

style.css:-
@media (max-width:600px){
    div{
        height:100px;
        width:100px;
    }
}

we can set limits also like

@media (max-width:600px) and (min-width:900px)  {
    in betwen 600 to 900 specify style can apply
}
